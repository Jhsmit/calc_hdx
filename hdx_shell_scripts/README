This folder contains files initially provided by Daniel Deredge, U Maryland,
for the prediction of HDX deuteration rates from Gromacs-format MD trajectories
using the method of Radou et al.

Adaptations to work with Gromacs 5 and to correct the calculation of intrinsic
rates were performed by Richard Bradshaw

Filenames/options are subject to adaptation for each analysis/trajectory and
should NOT be taken as default or recommended options.
